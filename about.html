            Hi, I'm Amit Raj, a passionate Full Stack Developer with 1 year of experience in building and maintaining dynamic, user-friendly web applications. I thrive at the intersection of design and functionality, leveraging my skills in both front-end and back-end development to deliver seamless digital experiences.

        <p>
            I specialize in developing scalable, performant web solutions using a wide range of technologies including JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, but I'm always eager to explore new tools and frameworks to improve my craft. My focus is on creating clean, efficient code while ensuring that the end-user experience is intuitive, responsive, and robust.

            From collaborating with cross-functional teams to deploying apps in production, I enjoy the entire development lifecycleâ€”from the initial idea to final delivery. I believe in the power of continuous learning and always strive to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.
        </p>
