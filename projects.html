            Project Overview : <br>
            The Task Manager is a full-featured, web-based application designed to help users manage their tasks, set deadlines, prioritize activities, and track progress in a user-friendly interface. Whether for personal use or team collaboration, this app aims to increase productivity and streamline task management.

            Key Features : <br>
            - User Authentication : Secure user login and registration using JWT-based authentication, allowing users to create and manage their task lists. <br>
            - CRUD Operations : Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks easily. Users can add new tasks, edit them, and mark them as completed or delete them. <br>
            - Prioritization : Tasks can be categorized by priority (Low, Medium, High) to help users focus on what matters most. <br>
            - Due Dates and Reminders : Set deadlines for each task with automatic reminders to keep users on track. <br>
            - Search & Filtering : Quickly find tasks using a search bar and filter tasks based on their status (Completed, Pending, Overdue). <br>
            - Responsive Design : Fully responsive layout that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. <br>
            - Data Persistence : Tasks are stored in a database, ensuring they are saved and available even after the user logs out.

        <p>
            Technologies Used : <br>
            - Front-End: React.js, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap for styling and a responsive, modern interface. <br>
            - Back-End : Node.js, Express.js to handle API requests and manage business logic. <br>
            - Database : MongoDB for storing user information and task data. <br>
            - Authentication : JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication. <br>
            - Deployment : Deployed on [Heroku / AWS / Netlify / Github Pages], ensuring easy access for users.
        </p>

        <p>
            Challenges Faced : <br>
            - Handling Dynamic Data : Managing task states efficiently with Reactâ€™s state management and ensuring smooth UI updates. <br>
            - User Authentication : Implementing secure authentication and authorization using JWT and ensuring that task data is protected. <br>
            - Cross-Device Compatibility : Making the app fully responsive to ensure a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
